### Instruction
    In this project you will see two subtasks, which aim to fit a sinx and build a classifier of handwritten Chinese characters. Here are some details about the classes and files:
##### Class Layer
    A public class name Layer, where everything related to a layer of any BPnetwork is defined.
##### Class sinx_network & character_network
    These two classes are quite similar to some extent. Using well-defined class Layer, we build network with several Layer instances.
##### sinx
    sinx.py is the main file of fitting a sinx graph.
##### Class ImageLoader
    ImageLoader is of great importance in this task. It loads the training data and test data from the given dataset. It contributs a lot by introducing GaussianBlur.
##### sin_test & character_test
    These two file stores the trained model and could be used instantly.
